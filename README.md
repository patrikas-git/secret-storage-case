# Case: Secret Storage

## Background

You've just joined a small team that has built a simple internal service. The application is a Spring Boot web app that requires authentication to access. It's packaged as a Docker container and run locally.

Your tech lead has asked you to take a look at the repository and address any security concerns you find with how the application is configured — particularly around how secrets are handled.

## Your Task

1. **Identify the security problem** in this repository.
2. **Fix it.** Implement a solution that resolves the issue.
3. **Describe your reasoning.** Briefly explain why the current approach is problematic and how your solution addresses it. If your ideal solution involves infrastructure or tooling beyond this repo, feel free to describe what that would look like — you don't need to build it, but show us your thinking.

## Running the Application

Build and run with Docker:

```sh
docker build -t secret-case .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your actually secret password> secret-case
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You'll be prompted for credentials.

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** *(check the source code)*

Or test with curl:

```sh
curl -u admin:<password> http://localhost:8080
```

## What We're Looking For

- Can you spot the problem?
- Is your solution practical and well-reasoned?
- How do you think about this in a broader context (local development, CI/CD, production)?
- No more than 15 minutes presentation on your solution and thoughts

There is no single "right" answer. We want to see how you think.

## Time Expectation

This should not take long. Don't over-engineer it. A clean, simple fix with clear reasoning is preferred over a complex one. You can hand-wave external services that might be part of your ideal design.
